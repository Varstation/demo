# From FASTQ to VCF
This is a very short practical demo from the fastq files to VCF files.
Some commands continue on the next line. These commands have backslashes \ in the end of the line to indicate that the newline character (not shown) should be ignored. You should be able to copy (Ctrl+c) the full length command and then paste it in the console window. An alternative is to copy one line at time, leaving the backslashes out. In a script file, newline characters have to escaped with backslashes.
